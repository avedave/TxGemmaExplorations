Instructions: Answer the following question about drug target interactions.

Context: Drug-target binding is the physical interaction between a drug and a specific biological molecule, such as a protein or enzyme. This interaction is essential for the drug to exert its pharmacological effect. The strength of the drug-target binding is determined by the binding affinity, which is a measure of how tightly the drug binds to the target. Kd is the dissociation constant of a drug-target complex. It is the concentration of drug at which half of the drug-target complexes have dissociated. A lower Kd value indicates a stronger binding affinity.

Question: Given the target amino acid sequence and compound SMILES string, predict their normalized binding affinity Kd from 000 to 1000, where 000 is minimum Kd and 1000 is maximum Kd.
