Excellent, that's exactly the information we need. Controlling the `temperature` in Ollama is straightforward. You are getting different answers because, by default, Ollama (and the underlying models) runs with a non-zero temperature to encourage more diverse and "creative" responses.

For your scientific screening, we need to force it into a deterministic mode. Hereâ€™s how you can set the temperature to 0 in Ollama, with options for different use cases.

### Method 1: Setting Temperature in the Command Line (for a single session)

This is the best method for quick, interactive tests. When you run `ollama run`, you can set parameters for that specific chat session.

1.  **Start your model session:**
    ```bash
    ollama run txgemma-predict  # Or whatever you have named your TxGemma model
    ```

2.  **Set the parameters *inside* the session:**
    Before you paste your prompt, use the `/set parameter` command. To ensure maximum reproducibility, you should set both `temperature` and `seed`. The `seed` parameter initializes the random number generator, and setting it to a fixed value ensures any residual randomness is also controlled.

    ```
    >>> /set parameter temperature 0
    Parameter 'temperature' set to '0'
    
    >>> /set parameter seed 42
    Parameter 'seed' set to '42'
    ```

3.  **Now, run your prompt:**
    After setting the parameters, you can paste your full DTI prompt. The model will now respond deterministically for the rest of this session.

    ```
    >>> Instructions: Answer the following question about drug target interactions...
        ...[rest of your prompt]...
    ```

### Method 2: Setting Temperature in an API Call (BEST for your script)

This is the **most important method for your proof-of-concept project**. When you write a Python script to loop through your compound library, you will make API calls to Ollama. You can specify the temperature in the JSON payload of each call.

Here is a sample Python script using the `requests` library:

```python
import requests
import json

# Your Ollama API endpoint
url = "http://localhost:11434/api/generate"

# The full prompt you constructed
your_prompt = """
Instructions: Answer the following question about drug target interactions.
...[the rest of your prompt text with SMILES and sequence]...
"""

# The data payload for the API request
data = {
    "model": "txgemma-predict",  # Make sure this matches your model name
    "prompt": your_prompt,
    "stream": False,  # Set to False to get the full response at once
    "options": {
        "temperature": 0.0,
        "seed": 42
    }
}

# Make the POST request
response = requests.post(url, json=data)

# Print the response from the model
if response.status_code == 200:
    response_data = response.json()
    print(response_data['response'].strip())
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
    print(response.text)
```

**Key part to understand:** The `options` dictionary is where you set the generation parameters. By including `"temperature": 0.0`, you are telling Ollama to run this specific prediction in deterministic mode.

### Method 3: Creating a Custom, Deterministic Model (Advanced/Permanent)

If you want to be absolutely sure that your `txgemma-predict` model *always* runs deterministically without having to set the parameters every time, you can create a new model variant using a `Modelfile`.

1.  **Create a file named `Modelfile`** (no extension).
2.  **Put the following text inside it:**

    ```Modelfile
    # This creates a new model based on the original txgemma
    FROM txgemma-predict

    # Set the default parameters for this new model
    PARAMETER temperature 0.0
    PARAMETER seed 42
    ```

3.  **Create the new model in your terminal:**
    ```bash
    ollama create txgemma-predict-deterministic -f ./Modelfile
    ```

4.  **Use your new model:**
    Now you can simply run `ollama run txgemma-predict-deterministic` or use `"model": "txgemma-predict-deterministic"` in your API calls, and it will *always* use `temperature=0` by default.

### Recommendation for Your Project

*   For your **screening script (Phase 1)**, **you must use Method 2 (API Call)**. This is the correct way to ensure every single prediction in your loop is deterministic and reproducible.
*   For your **interactive analysis with `TxGemma-Chat` (Phase 2)**, **Method 1 (Command Line)** is perfectly fine.
*   **Method 3 (Modelfile)** is a great option if you want to be extra safe and create a dedicated model for this kind of analytical work.

To verify, simply use Method 1 or 2 and run the exact same prompt two or three times. You should now get the identical numerical answer every time.
